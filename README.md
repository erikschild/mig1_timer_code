# mig1_timer_code
This repository contains data and code necessary to reproduce figures for the paper "Precise temporal control of neuroblast migration through combined regulation and feedback of a Wnt receptor". For data and code of modeling figures, please refer to https://github.com/amugler/mig1


To plot figure 1B+C+E, 2B+C, 3C, 4A+B+C+D, 5A+5sup1, S1, 2sup2+3sup2, and calculate corresponding statistics:
- Run corresponding .R file
- for Figure 2B+C.R and Figure 3C.R, note that the greek uppercase delta symbol may not properly show in the code, depending on encoding. UTF-8 encoding allows for greek letters
